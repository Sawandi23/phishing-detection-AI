## Abstract
Phishing is one of the most common and damaging cyber threats, targeting users through deceptive emails, websites, and messages. Traditional rule-based detection methods often fail to adapt to evolving attack patterns.

This research investigates the use of AI and machine learning techniques to detect phishing more accurately by analyzing patterns in data such as URLs, email content, and behavioral features. The study highlights the effectiveness of intelligent models in improving detection accuracy while reducing false positives.
